### Webcams

Choose from a variety of traffic monitoring webcams to show on the Pebble screen.
Due to the limited resolution and color palette, image quality can suffer.
Best results achieved during daylight hours.

#### Webcam selection menus

A few "hotspots" (busiest junctions) are promoted to the top of the menu to quickly access webcams around these areas in a sub-menu.
Alternatively, the list is also sorted by motorway.
